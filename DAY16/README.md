# **Day 16: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) — Creating New Data** 🌟

Welcome to the **Day 16** repository of the **30 Days of Deep Learning** series! 🎉 This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and resources for understanding and implementing **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.

---

## **📘 About This Notebook**
In this notebook, we explore:
1. **Introduction to GANs**:  
   - What GANs are and how they work.  
   - The interplay between the Generator and the Discriminator.  
   
2. **Mathematical Formulation**:  
   - The optimization objective of GANs.  
   - Loss functions used for training both networks.  

3. **Implementation**:  
   - Building a simple GAN to generate images from the MNIST dataset.  
   - Step-by-step explanation of the code.  

4. **Visualization**:  
   - Plotting generated images during training.  
   - Graphs for Generator and Discriminator losses.  

5. **Applications and Limitations**:  
   - Real-world use cases of GANs.  
   - Challenges in training GANs.
