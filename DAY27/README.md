# Day 27: Ethical Implications of AI - Bias, Fairness, and Accountability

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring the **ethical challenges of AI**, focusing on key areas such as **bias, fairness, and accountability**. AI systems impact critical domains, but they also raise concerns about inequity and transparency. This repository provides resources, tools, and examples to address these concerns effectively.

## Key Features

- **Understanding Bias**: Learn about data, algorithmic, and confirmation bias in AI systems.
- **Fairness Metrics**: Explore approaches like demographic parity, equal opportunity, and individual fairness.
- **Accountability Frameworks**: Implement strategies to enhance transparency, auditability, and human oversight.
- **Tools for Mitigation**: Utilize tools like [AI Fairness 360](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360) and [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn) to detect and mitigate bias.

## Usage

1. **Detect Bias**:
   Use the provided scripts or notebooks to analyze your dataset for bias.
   ```bash
   python scripts/detect_bias.py --dataset <dataset_path>
   ```

2. **Mitigate Bias**:
   Apply fairness-aware algorithms to correct detected biases.
   ```bash
   python scripts/mitigate_bias.py --dataset <dataset_path>
   ```

3. **Evaluate Fairness**:
   Measure fairness metrics like demographic parity and equal opportunity.
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate_fairness.py --dataset <dataset_path>
   ```
