## 🧐 What is Responsible AI?
Responsible AI ensures that AI systems are:
- **Fair**: Free from bias and discrimination.
- **Transparent**: Explainable and interpretable.
- **Accountable**: Responsible for decisions and outcomes.
- **Inclusive**: Catering to diverse and marginalized populations.
- **Safe**: Reliable and robust against failures.
- **Privacy-Respecting**: Protecting user data.
- **Socially Beneficial**: Solving real-world challenges.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Ethical AI Frameworks**: Step-by-step processes to integrate ethical principles in AI projects.
- **Bias Detection Tools**: Open-source libraries for fairness testing.
- **Explainability Techniques**: Methods to interpret and visualize AI decisions.
- **Case Studies**: Examples of Responsible AI in healthcare, finance, and sustainability.
- **Best Practices**: Strategies for building accountable AI systems.
