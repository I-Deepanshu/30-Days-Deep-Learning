# **Day 28: Interpretability of Deep Learning Models**

## **Understanding Black-Box Models**

Deep learning models are often criticized for being opaque or "black-box" systems, making it difficult to understand how decisions are made. This lack of interpretability limits trust, accountability, and broader adoption, especially in critical fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

This project focuses on exploring and implementing techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models, providing insights into their decision-making processes.
