## Overview

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) leverage deep learning to perceive their environment, make decisions, and navigate safely. This repository demonstrates two key areas of AVs:

1. **Perception**: Understanding the vehicleâ€™s surroundings using sensor data (cameras, LiDAR, etc.)
2. **Control**: Making real-time decisions and controlling the vehicle's movements based on perceived data.

The notebook includes practical code implementations using popular frameworks such as PyTorch and OpenAI Gym.

## Perception in Autonomous Vehicles

Perception enables AVs to "see" and understand their environment by processing data from various sensors.

### Object Detection
Detecting objects in real-time such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.

### Semantic Segmentation
Dividing an image into regions and classifying them to identify objects.

### Depth Estimation
Using stereo cameras or LiDAR to measure the distance of objects in the environment.

### Trajectory Prediction
Estimating the future path of nearby objects to avoid collisions and navigate safely.

## Control in Autonomous Vehicles

Control involves making decisions based on the perceived environment and executing actions such as steering, braking, and accelerating.

### Path Planning
Generating an optimal route from the current location to the destination while avoiding obstacles.

### Decision-Making
Making intelligent decisions in dynamic environments, such as changing lanes, stopping at traffic signals, or overtaking other vehicles.

### Actuation
Controlling the vehicle's mechanical systems, including throttle, brake, and steering.

### Reinforcement Learning for Control
Using reinforcement learning techniques to teach a vehicle to navigate and make decisions in a simulation environment.

## Challenges

1. **Real-Time Processing**: Deep learning models must process data with ultra-low latency for timely decision-making and safe operation.
2. **Handling Adversarial Scenarios**: AVs need to perform reliably in diverse and challenging conditions, such as bad weather or unexpected traffic scenarios.
3. **Safety and Robustness**: Ensuring that models are robust enough to handle rare and edge-case scenarios without causing accidents.
4. **Ethical Concerns**: Addressing moral dilemmas in decision-making, such as prioritizing passenger safety versus pedestrian safety.

## Future Trends

1. **Multimodal Learning**: Integrating data from multiple sensors like cameras, LiDAR, and radar to improve the accuracy and reliability of AV perception systems.
2. **Simulation-Based Training**: Using virtual environments like CARLA and AirSim to train AV models in a safe and scalable way before deploying them in the real world.
3. **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Developing AI models that provide transparent and understandable decision-making processes to increase trust and improve safety.
