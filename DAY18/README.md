## **30 Days of Deep Learning: Day 18**  

Welcome to the repository for **Day 18** of the **30 Days of Deep Learning** challenge! This day focuses on **Transfer Learning**, a transformative approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are adapted to solve new tasks with minimal computational resources and training time.

### **Overview**  

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and code for implementing Transfer Learning, with an emphasis on using pre-trained models like VGG16 for image classification. Key topics covered include:  
- Understanding Transfer Learning.  
- Feature extraction vs. fine-tuning.  
- Adapting pre-trained models for domain-specific tasks.  
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance.

   - Place training and validation data in the `data` folder.  
   - Ensure the folder structure follows:  
     ```plaintext  
     data/  
      â”œâ”€â”€ train/  
      â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ class1/  
      â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ class2/  
      â””â”€â”€ val/  
           â”œâ”€â”€ class1/  
           â”œâ”€â”€ class2/  
     ```  

3. Open the notebook:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook DAY18.ipynb  
   ```  

4. Execute the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.
