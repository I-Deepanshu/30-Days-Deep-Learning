# Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks: A Simplified RNN

This repository contains the implementation and explanation of **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks**, a simplified yet powerful variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The project is part of a 30-day deep learning series, specifically focusing on **Day 10**.

## Overview

GRU networks are designed to address the vanishing gradient problem commonly faced in traditional RNNs. They introduce a gating mechanism to control information flow, making them more computationally efficient and simpler compared to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

### Key Concepts:
- Introduction to GRU architecture.
- Comparison of GRU with other RNN variants.
- Hands-on implementation of a GRU network for sequence data.
- Performance evaluation with visualizations.

## Features
1. **GRU Theory**: Detailed explanation of the update and reset gates.
2. **Hands-On Implementation**: Using TensorFlow/Keras for sequence prediction.
3. **Visualizations**: Loss curves and other performance metrics.
4. **Resources**: Further reading and research papers.
