# **DAY19 - Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-Learning (CartPole-v1)**

Welcome to the **Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-Learning** repository! This project demonstrates how to train an intelligent agent to solve the **CartPole-v1** problem using a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) algorithm implemented in PyTorch.  

---

## **Overview**  

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm in machine learning where agents learn optimal behaviors by interacting with an environment. This project focuses on:  

- Understanding the fundamentals of RL.  
- Implementing a Deep Q-Learning agent.  
- Solving the **CartPole-v1** environment provided by OpenAI Gym.  

---

## **Environment Details**  

The **CartPole-v1** environment requires the agent to balance a pole on a moving cart by taking discrete actions (move left or right). The goal is to maximize the total reward by keeping the pole upright for as long as possible.  

- **State Space**: 4 continuous variables (cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole velocity).  
- **Action Space**: 2 discrete actions (move left or right).  
- **Reward**: +1 for every timestep the pole remains balanced.  
- **Termination**: The episode ends if the pole falls or the cart moves out of bounds.

## **Features**  

- **Deep Q-Network**: A fully connected neural network approximates the Q-values for state-action pairs.  
- **Experience Replay**: Enhances training stability by breaking correlations in consecutive samples.  
- **Epsilon-Greedy Policy**: Balances exploration and exploitation during training.  
- **Visualization**: Tracks and plots agent performance over episodes.

## **Requirements**  

### **Dependencies**  

Install the following dependencies to run the project:  

- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch  
- OpenAI Gym  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

You can install the required libraries using:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/I-Deepanshu/30-Days-Deep-Learning/tree/main/DAY19
cd DAY19
```  

This will:  
- Train the agent in the CartPole-v1 environment.  
- Save the trained model as `q_network_cartpole.pth`.  
- Display the reward plot to visualize training progress.  

### **2. Test the Agent**  

To test the trained agent, run:  

```bash
python test.py
```  

This will load the saved model and demonstrate the agentâ€™s performance in the environment.
