## Autoencoder Overview

Autoencoders are neural networks designed to:
- Learn efficient data representations (latent spaces).
- Reconstruct the original data from the compressed representation.

### Architecture:
1. **Encoder**: Compresses input data into a smaller latent space.
2. **Decoder**: Reconstructs the original input from the latent representation.

## Applications of Autoencoders

- **Data Denoising**: Removing noise from images or signals.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing high-dimensional data while preserving key features.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying deviations from normal data patterns.
- **Feature Extraction**: Learning efficient representations for downstream tasks.

## Denoising Autoencoder Implementation

### Objective:
- Remove noise from MNIST images while retaining critical features of the original data.

### Model Details:
- Input: Noisy MNIST images (28x28 pixels).
- Output: Reconstructed clean MNIST images.
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Optimizer: Adam.
